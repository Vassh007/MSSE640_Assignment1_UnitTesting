# Triangle Classification Java Project (MSSE Assignment 1 Unit Testing v1.3) 

## Introduction
In this project, I developed a Java program to classify triangles and applied unit testing by the assignment requirements. The Triangle Classification project aims to ensure efficient code functionality and error handling. As stated in *The Art of Software Testing, 3rd Edition* by Glenford J. Myers, Corey Sandler, and Tom Badgett, "Software testing is a process designed to ensure that computer code performs as intended and does not exhibit unintended behavior." The program accepts three integer side lengths and determines if the triangle is Scalene, Isosceles, Equilateral, or Invalid. It handles error cases explicitly, such as invalid triangles where the sum of two sides is not greater than the third or when any side length is zero or negative. If the input is invalid, the program notifies the user. This approach provides comprehensive testing and achieves the required goals stated in the book. As Meyer had advised,"....write a set of test casesâ€”specific sets of dataâ€”to properly test a relatively simple program. Create a set of test data for the programâ€”data the program must handle correctly to be considered a successful program."

Unit tests were designed to cover a range of typical and edge-case inputs for triangle identification. Meyers supports this approach, stating, "...test every possible permutation of a program." Selected tests ensure each type of valid triangle is recognized while accurately identifying various invalid inputs. For example, there are tests for a valid scalene triangle, a valid equilateral triangle, and a valid isosceles triangle, as well as invalid cases, including a zero-length side and a set of lengths that do not form a triangle. As stated by Myers about his test case evaluation, "Do you have a test case that represents a valid scalene triangle?" and "Do you have at least three test cases that represent valid isosceles triangles such that you have tried all three permutations of two equal sides (such as 3, 3, 4; 3, 4, 3; and 4, 3, 3)?" These particular tests were chosen based on the guidance from Chapters 1 to 3 of *The Art of Software Testing*. Chapter 1 provided a self-assessment with specific categories of test cases relevant to the triangle problem.

## Detail of the Project
This project was developed using IntelliJ IDEA to meet the requirements outlined by the rubric. The core functionality is encapsulated in the method `identifyTriangle(int a, int b, int c)` within the `TriangleIdentify` class. This method accepts three integer inputs representing the sides of a triangle and returns a classification: "Equilateral," "Isosceles," "Scalene," or "Invalid." Inspired by *The Art of Software Testing, 3rd Edition*, I devised a checklist to validate the input sides consisting of 14 questions highlighted in the book:
### Valid Triangles:
- 1	Did you test a valid scalene triangle? Example: 3,4,5
- 2. Did you test a valid equilateral triangle? Example: 2,2,2
- 3. Did you test a valid isosceles triangle? Example: 3,3,4
- 4. Did you test all permutations for an isosceles triangle (three different arrangements of two equal sides)? Examples: 3,3,4; 3,4,3; 4,3,3
### Invalid (Rainy Day) Scenarios:
-	5. Did you test zero length side (invalid)? Example: 0,5,5
-	6. Did you test negative length side (invalid)? Example: -1,4,5
-	7. Did you test when the sum of two sides exactly equals the third side (invalid)? Example: 1,2,3
-	8. Did you test all permutations of question 7's scenario? Examples: 1,2,3; 1,3,2; 3,1,2
-	9. Did you test when the sum of two sides is less than the third side (invalid)? Example: 1,2,4
-	10. Did you test all permutations of question 9's scenario? Examples: 1,2,4; 1,4,2; 4,1,2
-	11. Did you test when all sides are zero (0,0,0)?
### Exceptional and Additional Scenarios:
-	12. Did you test with non-integer numbers (like decimal numbers)? (optional unless required explicitly by your professor) Example: 2.5,3.5,5.5
-	13. Did you test when you input the wrong number of sides (like only two instead of three)? (optional unless required explicitly by your professor) Example: 2,4
### Clarity of Test Cases:
-	14. For every test case you created, did you write down what output you expected from the program? Example: Side A: 3, Side B: 4, Side C: 5 â†’ Scalene
The function ensures the validity of the sides by checking conditions such as negative or zero-length sides and violations of the triangle inequality theorem.
Additionally, I implemented the `main` method as a console-based driver to prompt users to sequentially input three integer values for triangles. The method utilizes Java's `Scanner` object (`Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)`) allowing user interaction via the console. This ensures that users can enter integers representing the lengths of the triangle sides one by one until the console outputs a message such as "The triangle is scalene" (or isosceles/equilateral), or an error message if the inputs are invalid.
```Java
System.out.println("The triangle is: " + result);
```
